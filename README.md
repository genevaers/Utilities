## Description

This repo contains GenevaERS modules that can be called outside
of and independent of GenevaERS.  

These modules allow for GenevaERS functionality to be embedded in
other programs.  For example, the GenevaERS IO module, GVBUR20, can
be used to perform GenevaERS parallel overlapped BSAM IO operations 
in a COBOL or other Language Environment program.
